## nargil : A numerical simulation toolset

**nargil** is a set of tools for numerical simulation of PDEs. It is written
in C++ and makes use of PETSc, deal.II, Hypre, Eigen, MTL and a number of other
numerical libraries.

This library is developed and maintained by the computational hydraulics group at institute of computational engineering and science. For the final project of parallel computing course, I performed weak scaling analysis on the implicit CG solver implemented by the PETSc library.
